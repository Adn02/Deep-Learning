This folder contains implementations and experiments with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as part of my coursework, focusing on two prominent architectures: AlexNet and ResNet. These homeworks/projects demonstrate the application of CNNs to image classification tasks, specifically using the CIFAR-10 dataset.
Below are the details of the assignments completed:

For Homework 2:
- Adapt the AlexNet architecture for the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of lower-resolution images.
  -  Simplify the original AlexNet model to improve training speed while ensuring relatively high accuracy.
  -  Train the modified model from scratch and report training loss, validation loss, and validation accuracy after training.
  -  Compare the number of parameters in the modified AlexNet against the original AlexNet architecture.
  -  Explore the application of dropout techniques during training and compare the results against the baseline model without dropout.

- Implement and analyze ResNet-18 and compare it with the previously covered ResNet-11 architecture.
  -  Build and train the ResNet-18 model on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
  -  Plot the training loss, validation loss, and validation accuracy throughout the training process.
  -  Compare the classification accuracy and model size between ResNet-11 and ResNet-18 to understand the impact of increased network depth.
  -  Investigate how the complexity of the model grows as the network depth increases.
  -  Implement dropout techniques for ResNet-11 and ResNet-18 and report the training results and validation accuracy.
