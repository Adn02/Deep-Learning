This folder contains the implementations of MLPs as part of my coursework. Below are the details of the assignments completed:

For Homework 1: 
- Develop an MLP with three hidden layers to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.
  - Train the model from scratch with randomized parameters. After 20 epochs, plot the training loss, accuracy, and validation accuracy. Analyze the need for additional epochs and check for signs of overfitting

- Implement MLPs to predict housing prices using different feature sets.
  - Build an MLP that regresses housing prices based on a 20% training and 80% validation split without one-hot encoding. Plot training and validation results and report final accuracy and model complexity.
  - Repeat the regression task with one-hot encoding of features and compare results against the previous mode
  - Increase the complexity of the model from 2.b and analyze the changes in performance
